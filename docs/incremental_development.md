# Incremental Development Path for GDB Game AI

This document outlines a step-by-step approach to building GDB game support, from basic memory reading to advanced AI strategies.

## Phase 1: Basic GDB Integration

### Step 1: Understanding GDB Basics
- Learn how to attach GDB to a running process
- Understand memory inspection commands
- Try basic GDB commands on the 2048 game

```bash
# Start the game in one terminal
2048

# Attach GDB in another terminal
gdb -p $(pgrep 2048)
```

### Step 2: Finding the Game Board in Memory
- Use pattern searching to find the board
- Verify that the memory location contains valid game data
- Save the board address for future use

```gdb
# Use the find-board command from our script
source gdb/find-board.gdb
find-board

# When a candidate is found, examine it
x/16wx 0xYOUR_ADDRESS

# Save the address if it looks like a valid board
set $board_addr = 0xYOUR_ADDRESS

# View the board in formatted output
show-board
```

### Step 3: Manual Game Control
- Set breakpoints on input functions
- Manually return key values to control the game
- Understand the game's control flow

```gdb
# Break on the input function
break wgetch

# When the breakpoint hits, return a key value
return 115  # 's' key for down movement
```

## Phase 2: Basic AI Strategy

### Step 1: Automating Input
- Create a simple script to automatically send inputs
- Use breakpoint commands to inject key presses
- Set up a basic loop for continuous play

```gdb
# Set up automatic command execution on breakpoint
break wgetch
commands
silent
return 115  # Always move down
end
continue
```

### Step 2: Implementing Simple Strategy
- Read the board state before making a move
- Implement a priority-based strategy (e.g., prefer down > right > left > up)
- Validate moves before sending them

```bash
# Load our simple AI script
source gdb/simple-ai-fixed.gdb

# Enable the AI
ai-enable
```

## Phase 3: Enhanced Python Interface

### Step 1: Setting Up Python GDB Integration
- Understand how Python interacts with GDB
- Create a board representation class
- Implement basic board state reading

```python
# Using the Python GDB API
import gdb

# Read board state
def read_board(addr):
    board = []
    for i in range(16):
        val = int(gdb.parse_and_eval(f"*((int*)({addr} + {i} * 4))"))
        board.append(val)
    return board
```

### Step 2: Developing AI Logic
- Implement move validation
- Create a strategy class
- Add board state tracking over time

```python
# Load our Python AI
source src/python/ai/basic_ai.py

# Enable the AI
ai-2048
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### Step 1: Web Interface
- Create a REST API for GDB control
- Implement a web client for visualization
- Add remote control capabilities

```bash
# Start the web interface
python -m src.python.web.bridge
```

### Step 2: Advanced AI Strategies
- Implement expectimax algorithm
- Add look-ahead capability
- Optimize for high scores

```bash
# Run with advanced AI
python main.py python --advanced
```

## Phase 5: Experimentation

### Step 1: Strategy Comparison
- Set up a framework for comparing different AIs
- Collect performance metrics
- Visualize results

### Step 2: Extending to Other Games
- Apply the same techniques to different games
- Develop a general-purpose framework
- Create game-specific adaptors

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with GDB Game AI, start with Phase 1:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aygp-dr/gdb-game-ai.git
cd gdb-game-ai

# Install prerequisites
sudo apt install gdb 2048

# Start the game
2048

# In another terminal, start GDB and load our scripts
gdb -p $(pgrep 2048)
source gdb/autoload.gdb

# Find the board
find-board

# When you've found a valid board, enable the AI
ai-2048
```

This incremental approach allows you to build understanding step by step, from basic GDB usage to advanced AI strategies.
