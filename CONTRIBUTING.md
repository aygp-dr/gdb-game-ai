## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests.
Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

### Feature Requests

We would love to hear your ideas for new features and improvements!
Open an issue with the tag "enhancement" to suggest a new feature.

## Coding Style

* Python code should follow PEP 8
* Use meaningful variable names
