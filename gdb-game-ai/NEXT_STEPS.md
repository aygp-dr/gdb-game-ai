# Next Steps for 2048 AI Development

## Immediate Tasks

1. **Source Analysis** âœ…
   - Run `analyze_2048_source.py` to understand the code structure
   - Look at the generated `structure_analysis.json`
   - Key files to examine: `engine.c`, `gfx_curses.c`

2. **Board Discovery** 
   - Use `claude_code_interface.py` to find the board systematically
   - Try multiple search strategies
   - Verify the board address by checking the pattern

3. **AI Implementation**
   - Simple strategy: Down > Right > Left > Up
   - Advanced: Implement expectimax algorithm
   - Ultra: Use ML model trained on successful games

## Experiments to Run

### Experiment 1: Board Structure
- Goal: Definitively locate the board in memory
- Method: Search for known patterns, verify with visual board
- Output: Exact memory address and layout

### Experiment 2: Input Mechanics  
- Goal: Understand how input is processed
- Method: Trace through wgetch, find key processing
- Output: Reliable method to inject moves

### Experiment 3: AI Strategies
- Goal: Compare different AI approaches
- Strategies to test:
  - Corner strategy (keep highest in corner)
  - Snake pattern
  - Expectimax with different depths
  - Monte Carlo sampling

### Experiment 4: Learning
- Goal: Train AI to improve over time
- Method: Record game states and outcomes
- Use successful games to train decision model

## Code Improvements

1. **Better Memory Search**
   ```python
   # More sophisticated board finding
   def find_board_advanced(gdb):
       # Check data segment
       # Look for 16 consecutive ints
       # Verify power-of-2 pattern
   ```

2. **Robust Input Injection**
   ```python
   # Set up proper breakpoint handling
   def setup_ai_control(gdb):
       gdb.send("break wgetch")
       gdb.send("commands")
       # ... AI logic
   ```

3. **Game State Tracking**
   ```python
   class GameState:
       def __init__(self):
           self.history = []
           self.scores = []
           self.max_tile_achieved = 0
   ```

## Advanced Ideas

1. **Parallel Exploration**: Run multiple GDB instances to test strategies
2. **State Space Analysis**: Map all possible board states from position
3. **Optimal Play Proof**: Prove certain positions guarantee 2048
4. **Speed Running**: Optimize for fastest 2048 achievement
5. **Pattern Library**: Build library of board patterns and best moves

## Integration Ideas

1. **Web Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of AI playing
2. **Twitch Bot**: Stream AI playing 2048
3. **Training Mode**: AI teaches human optimal moves
4. **Puzzle Mode**: Set up specific board states to solve

## Research Questions

1. What's the theoretical maximum score?
2. Can we predict RNG (tile spawning)?
3. What's the optimal depth for expectimax?
4. How much does corner strategy matter?
5. Can we find forced-win positions?

## Tools to Build

1. **Board Visualizer**: Show board state in GDB
2. **Move Validator**: Ensure moves are legal
3. **Strategy Analyzer**: Compare different approaches
4. **Game Replayer**: Replay saved games
5. **Pattern Matcher**: Find recurring patterns

## Next Session Goals

When you next work with Claude Code:

1. Run the source analyzer
2. Use the interface to find the board
3. Implement basic AI
4. Run 100-game experiment
5. Analyze results
6. Iterate on strategy

Remember: The goal is not just to play 2048, but to understand it deeply and push the boundaries of what's possible!
